Q1: 
a-the time range is from jan2004 till dec2014 -- 12 years.
b-144 values.
c-montly.
Q2:
the paramter frequency refers to the cycle the data takes. it's set to 12 becayse the year has 12 months.
Q3:
a-done.
b- yes, i guess there's a linear trend in the data.
c- there's no seasonality in this time series in my opinion. there's is not reqular pattern observed over the course of a year in this data.
Q4: the function stl does  a seasonal trend decomposition of the time series.
Q5:
a- for a time series to be stationary, the mean and variance should not change overtime.
b- i guess this one is a non stationary time series, becuase the mean changes over time.
Q6:
a- done.
b- the condition of the mean is met. but the variance is not. so it's not stationary.
c- Differencing can help stabilise the mean of a time series by removing changes in the level of a time series, and therefore eliminating (or reducing) trend and seasonality. As well as looking at the time plot of the data, the ACF plot is also useful for identifying non-stationary time series.
Q7:
a- done.
b- no, mean is not.
c- mean.
d- logartihm doesn't guarantee making the timeseries stationary.
Q8:
a - both mean and variance conditions are satisfied.
b- done.
Q9:
a- the series should be stationary and univariate. 
b-
c-
 *p is the number of autoregressive terms
 *d is the number of differences
 *q is the number of moving average terms
